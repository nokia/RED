## General information 

RED is modern editor based on Java IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ in future) to allow quick and comfortable work with Robot testware.

**Latest release: https://github.com/nokia/RED/releases/latest**

## What RED provides:
* text editor with validation and code colouring
* table editors like in Ride (currently read-only)
* debug&remote debug with:
	* breakpoints
	* testcase stepping (step into, step over)
	* runtime variable lookup & modification
* code assistance & completion for variables, keywords,testcases,resources and libraries
* real time testcase validation
* execution view
* support for plugins via Eclipse mechanisms

## Binaries distribution:
RED is distributed as Eclipse feature to be installed on existing Eclipse platform. 

### Update existing RED installation
We recommend to not to do direct update of newer version, instead perform unistall old RED and install new RED after Eclipse restart.
Open Help -> Installation Details, select old RED feature and perform unistall, restart Eclipse
