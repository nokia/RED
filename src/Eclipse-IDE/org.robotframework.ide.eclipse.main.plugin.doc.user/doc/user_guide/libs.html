<h2>Recognizing external libraries and variable files in RED</h2>

<h3>External libraries installed by pip or included in testcase by file path</h3>

In order to provide validation and keyword assistance of external libraries ( any library not bundled with RobotFramework), external library <b>needs</b> to be included in <b> red.xml </b> file in the Referenced libraries part. </br>RED Editor does not add external library by itself by default - there are cases where tester is working with multiple versions of libraries and needs to have exact control which library is taken to validation and keyword assistance in RED. <br>
<br>
There are few ways to include library into red.xml
<h3>Add library from Project Explorer</h3>
External libraries as python files can be directly included to red.xml file by right clicking on file and using option <br>
<i>Robot Framework -> Add Library to red.xml </i>
<h3>Quick Fix - shortcut CTRL+1</h3>
Lets focus on following example:
<br><br><img src="libs/libs_1.png"> <br><br>

In sample testcase, there are two libraries included. CalculatorLibrary.py is custom user local library placed in the same folder as testcase, Selenium2Library was installed by pip.<br>
Both libraries are not recognized by RED as libraries names are underlined and error markers are placed next to line numbers. <br>Note the light bulb in error marker - it indicates that there is Quick Fix action available.  
<br>Click on the library name in test editor, open right click menu and choose Quick Fix or use CTRL+1
<br><br><img src="libs/libs_2.png"> <br><br>
Double click on Discover option, RED will search either PythonPath or library file path, if successful library will be added to Referenced libraries in red.xml

<br>
All changes are stored in red.xml, if you need to modify them, open red.xml using Eclipse Default Editor.

<h3>Using libspec file when external library is not present locally</h3>

In some scenarios,testware edit happens on different host than test runtime thus it is undesirable/unnecessary to install/import all libraries as on remote host. RobotFramework provides possibility to generate an xml file with list of keywords, this also provides agile test development where libraries are developed in parallel to test cases.<br>
Libspec file can be included instead of link to external library by using red.xml editor.<br><br>
For more information about LibDoc please refer to <a href="https://robot-framework.readthedocs.org/en/2.9/_modules/robot/libdoc.html">https://robot-framework.readthedocs.org/en/2.9/_modules/robot/libdoc.html</a> <br>
<h3>Errors while importing Referenced Libraries </h3>
During library import, RED is generating LibDoc from given python file using local python interpreter. 
Whenever python encounter problem, it will be shown as popup window with Python exception
<br><br><img src="libs/libs_8.png"> <br><br>
This indicates that some of the dependencies are missing on your local machine which may affect testcase execution.    
<h2>Importing Python Variable files into code assistance</h2>

Python variable files can be imported to RED by adding path in red.xml<br>
Such imported variable file is seen anywhere across project and behaves as Global Variable. <br>
Any file included in Variable Files section in red.xml will be taken into use during run or debug from RED.
