<h2>General usage hints</h2>
<h3>Tab key behavior </h3>
Tab key press behavior is set by default to be aware of the file type. For .tsv files each Tab will produce item separator, for text files 4 spaces will generated. <br>
In Robot Framework preferences (Window -> Preferences under Source section), Tab behavior can be changed if needed.

<h3>Validating & revalidating whole project/workspace</h3>
Validation of test case is triggered by any user actions, it is also done during files&project imports.<br>
Whenever there is a change in multiple files (for instance find&replace) or  big file import/deletion, it is good to force revalidation of project.<br>
It is done accessing option Project -> Clean ...

At the bottom right of RED, progress bar will appear with the status of validation.<br>
<h3>Automatic source formatting CTRL+SHIFT+F</h3>
Formatting source is Eclipse based mechanism which provides code formatting with arbitrary ruleset. <br>
For now, <b>code formatting in RED is meant to be proof of functionality, it is not configurable.</b><br>
In near future we will provide a way to include custom rule sets for code formatting and check style.<br>
It is invoked by right click menu in Source editor.<br>
