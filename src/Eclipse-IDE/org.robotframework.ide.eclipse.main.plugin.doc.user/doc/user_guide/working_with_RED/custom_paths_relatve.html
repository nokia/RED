<h2>Custom python/class paths and path relativeness</h2>
Settings available in <b>red.xml -> Referenced Libraries</b>
<h3>Custom python/class paths</h3>
Certain RED usage scenarios such as library development, requires custom path for python/jython interpreter to fulfill dependencies. <br>
Either this can be done on OS level by updating environment variables or can be included in red.xml.<br>
Path entries can be absolute or relative, they will be taken into use anytime when interpreter executes (testcase and debug run or libdoc generation). <br>

<h3>Path relativeness</h3>
By default, relative paths are resolved around Project scope although in some scenarios like storing Robot testsuites in one project and libraries in other, there is a need to change relativeness regards to Workspace.<br>
This can be changed in red.xml under Referenced Libraries -> Path part.
<br><b>Note that relativeness setting is used together with class/python path and libraries only.</b>
