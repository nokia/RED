<h2>Limiting validation scope</h2>

<p>When working with bigger projects, it is good to limit validation scope to project parts relevant to current work to 
speed up validation and reduce test error markers to be relevant to files under scope.
</p>

<p>Excluded project parts are still parsed so code completion is preserved, just validation is omitted thus validation 
errors and warnings are skipped for excluded folders.
</p>

<dl class="note">

   <dd>Excluded project parts will be skipped also in other features connected to validation like Library Autodiscovering and Robot Framework Lint analysis.
   </dd>
</dl>

<p>Include/exclude can be triggered in Project Explorer under right click menu on selected folders:</p>

<p>Include/exclude can also be found in red.xml editor under Validation table - include/exclude action is available 
as right click menu.
</p>

<dl class="note">
   <dt>Note</dt>
   <dd>All hidden project parts (files and folders with names starting with ".") are automatically excluded from validation.
   </dd>
</dl>

<p>In case of big amounts of .txt or .tsv files which are not Robot test cases, validation can be excluded on files 
bigger than size threshold.</p> 
	
<dl class="note">

   <dd>File size limit is not taken into account during validation of files currently edited within Suite Editor.
   </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that exclude folders are grayed out, exclude state is inherited from parent folders.
