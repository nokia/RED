	<h2>Create Project, add test and run</h2>
	
	In order to start working with RED & Eclipse, you need to set up couple of things first.

    Robot Perspective
    Workspace & project
    Create TestSuite
        Content assistant
    Running TestSuite
        Console and message log
        Execution status

<h3>Robot Perspective</h3>
<p>
All RED activities are performed within 2 perspectives: <i>Robot</i> , <i>Debug</i> . Former one is used to construct and execute tests, later one is for debugging test-cases.

To start working with RED, you should activate Robot perspective first.
</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Check if you have already set Robot perspective: 
	<br/></br>
    <img src="create_run/perspective_1.png" > </li>

    <li>Set perspective to Robot by issuing action: <i>Window -> Open Perspective -> Other ... -> Robot</i></li>
	</ul>
<h3>Workspace & project</h3>
<p>
<b>Workspace</b> stores all global Eclipse & Red preferences, if not set previously (first run or workspace path is non valid) Eclipse will show dialog to set path.</br>
User can always switch workspaces, and if necessary, perform projects import from locations outside of current workspace.</br>
Switching Workspace is done by menu action: <i>File -> Switch Workspace ...</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>Project</b> is an equivalent to folder in OS, it stores files and settings relevant to a group of files.
In order to work with RED, <b>Robot Project</b> has to be created.<br>

Create new Project can be done by:
<ul>
       <li><i>File->New-> Robot Project </i>(item can be found under selection <i>New -> Project .. -> Robot Framework -> Robot Project </i>)</li>
       <li>Right click menu on Project Explorer with selection as above</li>
</ul>
If you which to import anything into Workspace ( already existing Project) or into Project (existing testcases), menu <i>Import ... </i>will open up wizard.</br>
Upon creating Project, you should have see similar structure in Project Explorer tree which will also indicate that RobotFramework is visible to Eclipse</br></br>

<h3>Create TestSuite</h3>
<p>
To create sample test you should invoke action: <i>File -> New -> Other ... -> Robot Framework -> Robot Test Suite</i>. Same action can be accessed by right click menu.

RED consists of 2 different modes of editing, a Table (Ride-like style) and Text style. </br>
By default Table editor is used when TestCase file is opened. </br></br>

Additionally, Source tab shows text representation of TestSuite:</br></br>

<h4>Content assistant</h4>
<p>
Just like other modern Developments Environments, RED supports content assistance/code completion. </br>
When editing tab or item in text editor, press CTRL+SPACE keys to activate hints for Keywords.</p>
<h3>Running TestSuite</h3>
<p>
To run TestSuite, <i>Run</i> button needs to be selected or right-click menu on file can be issued.</br></br>
<img src="create_run/toolbar-1.png">

<h4>Limiting test cases to be run </h4>
To limit list of test cases to be run, open <i>Run Configurations ...</i>, <br></br>
<img src="create_run/run_1.png"></br>
in Robot part you can specify which test cases should be run by using either tags or include/exclude list of test cases in active project. </br></br>

</p>
<h4>Console and message log</h4>
<p>
During TestSuite execution, RED displays RobotFramework console and message logs.</br>
Those information are available by view Console and Message Log, by default visible in the Robot perspective or by <i>Window -> Show View -> Other.... -> Robot</i></br></br>
<img src="create_run/console_1.png"> </br>
If any of those 2 views are missing, best way is to reset perspective settings by using action <i>Window -> Reset Perspective ...</i>
</p>
<h4>Execution status</h4>

RED can show execution status of TestCases along with outcome result and execution time. </br></br>
<img src="create_run/exec_1.png"> </br>
Execution View is not in default Robot perspective thus it needs to be manually added. <br/>
Visit <i>Window-> Show View -> Robot -> Execution View</i>
