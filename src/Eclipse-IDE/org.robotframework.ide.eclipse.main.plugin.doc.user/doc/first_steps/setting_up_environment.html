<h2>Establishing environment</h2>

<p>As mentioned <a href="download_install.html">earlier</a> RED requires Python interpreter with Robot Framework 
installed in your system. Without it numerous RED features will not work: you will not be able to run and debug
tests, the project will not be validated or content assistant will not give any proposals for keywords
coming from libraries.
</p>

<p>If there is no environment established RED will signal this: error will be reported by workspace validation
for each red.xml file in your projects or the dialog will be presented when opening editor:
</p>

<p><img src="images/error_missing_env.png"/>
</p>
<p><img src="images/error_missing_env2.png"/>
</p>

<p>There are two ways in which Python &amp; RF environment can be established: automatically or manually via Preferences 
</p>


<h3>Automatic environment detection</h3>

<p>In most cases there is actually nothing required from user and RED will automatically detect Python installation.
This only require that the path to one of those executables (Unix-like / Windows):
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="block">python</span> / <span class="block">python.exe</span>
    </li>
    <li><span class="block">jython</span> / <span class="block">jython.exe</span>
    </li>
    <li><span class="block">ipy</span> / <span class="block">ipy.exe</span>
    </li>
    <li><span class="block">ipy64</span> / <span class="block">ipy64.exe</span>
    </li>
    <li><span class="block">pypy</span> / <span class="block">pypy.exe</span>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>is appended to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)" class="external" target="_blank">
<span class="code">PATH</span></a> environment variable in your system.
</p>

<dl class="warning">
   <dt>Warning</dt>
   <dd>On Unix-like systems (Linux / macOS) executables are often named <span class="block">python2</span> or 
   <span class="block">python3</span> for respective versions of python. As of now RED does not recognize
   such executables even if they are appended to <span class="block">PATH</span> variable. Probably the best
   solution for this problem is to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link" 
   class="external" target="_blank">symlink</a> named <span class="block">python</span> targeted to either 
   <span class="block">python2</span> or <span class="block">python3</span>.
   </dd>
</dl>


<h3>Manual environment configuration</h3>

<p>It is possible to add environments manually in 
<i><a class="command" href="javascript:executeCommand('org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.robotframework.ide.eclipse.main.plugin.preferences.installed)')">
Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Robot Framework-&gt;Installed frameworks</a></i>. Simply use 
<span class="block">Add...</span> button to open dialog in which the directory can be chosen. It should be the 
directory which contains one of the executable files listed above. 
</p>

<p>If proper directory is chosen you will see it listed in the table together with the information
about version of Robot Framework installed in it. Otherwise the added entry will be marked with orange/red color
and tooltip would show information about the problem (either it was not recognized as Python directory or there
is no RF installed).
</p>

<p>Multiple environments can be defined here, but only one should be selected and it will be used by all project unless
the project overrides this setting locally in its <span class="block">red.xml</span> configuration file.
</p>

<p>Additionally the automatic recognition process can be started from preference page through 
<span class="block">Discover</span> button. It will look through directories in your <span class="block">PATH</span>
variable to see if any of listed executables are there.
</p>
